The equations generalize to any dimensions, but only really make sense in up to three dimensions."

    "- **Domain Dimensions:** 32x32 grid\n",
    "- **Input Field:** randomly generated velocity field, length: [0,5)\n",
    "- **Input Forces:** none (closed system)\n",
    "- **Number of Scenes:** 1000\n",
    "- **Steps simulated per scene:** 5\n",

    "In addition to calculating the velocity vector for each grid cell, FluidSim also calculates the rotation, a scalar describing how much the fluid in the cell is rotating. Each time step in the dataset is a grid of x velocity, y velocity, and rotation field values.\n",

    "\n",

    "Our SNN performs X% better than the GNN at predicting the next frame of a fluid flow. We attribute this to the higher order features it can represent, providing more information to the model.\n",

    "Our SNN performs about the same as the GNN baseline. The 'higher order' features of our model are somewhat contrived, as they are constructed from a regular grid and do not encode any additional meaning about the actual fluid flow. \n",

    "Our SNN performs worse than the GNN baseline. The 'higher order' features of our model are somewhat contrived, as they are constructed from a regular grid and do not encode any additional meaning about the actual fluid flow, so these additional features add noise to the model and lead to worse performance."
